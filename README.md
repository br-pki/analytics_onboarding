# Analytics Onboarding Task

The purpose of this task is to
1. ensure your coding environment is ready for primetime
1. give you an opportunity to showcase your skills
1. give us a chance to collaborate on an analytics task

# Setup your environment
Before cloning this GH repo you'll want to set up your local environment first. I'm assuming you have some prior experience here but let me know where I can help.

**Python** - I recommend starting with the [latest Python 3.x release](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**IDE** - There are lots of options here. Work with what you prefer. If you need a recommendation: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Jupyter Lab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/).

**GitHub** - Create a GH account using your PKI email address. My profile is here: https://github.com/br-pki). If you're new to Git and GitHub then I recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to simplify the process of cloning a repo, creating branches, and making commits.

**virtual environments** - You *may* be able to get away without relying on virtual environments but I don't recommend it. You'll likely run into conflicts between packages or want to use different versions of the same package and want to kick yourself. [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) is preferred for Python 3.

**Extras** - if you like working with Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell then that's fine, I prefer [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). We aim to adhere to the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) although our focus is on deliverables (analysis, visualizations, insights, etc.)

# Clone this repo and start working
Once your local environment is set up you can clone this repo, create a branch, and start working on the analytics task!
