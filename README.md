# Analytics Onboarding Task

The purpose of this task is to
1. ensure your coding environment is ready for prime time
1. give you an opportunity to showcase your skills
1. give us a chance to collaborate on an analytics task

# Setup your environment
Before cloning this GitHub repository you'll want to set up your local environment. I'm assuming you have some prior experience here but let me know where I can help.

**Python** - I recommend starting with the [latest Python 3.x release](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**IDE** - There are lots of options here. Work with what you prefer. If you need a recommendation then use either [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Jupyter Lab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/).

**GitHub** - Create a GitHub account using your PKI email address. If you're new to Git and GitHub then I recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to simplify the process of cloning a repository, creating branches, and making commits.

**virtual environments** - You *may* be able to get by without relying on virtual environments but I don't recommend it. You'll likely run into conflicts between packages or want to use different versions of the same package and want to kick yourself later. [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) is preferred for Python 3.

**Extras** - If you like working with Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell then that's fine, I prefer [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). We aim to adhere to the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) although our focus is on deliverables (analysis, visualizations, insights, etc.) so adherence may be spotty.

# Clone this GitHub repository and start working!
Once your local environment is set up you can clone this repository, create a new branch (i.e. don't work directly on main), and start working on the analytics task!

**Clone a repository using GitHub Desktop** - Open GitHub Desktop and click on File | Clone repository | URL and copy/paste this repository's URL. Set your local path as you see fit and click 'Clone'. If you're managing Git in another way and need help then let me know.

**Create/activate a virtual environment** - Generally, you'll have a unique virtual environment per repository and/or project. The venv link above is quite thorough and should guide you through this process.

**Open EDA.ipynb** - You're ready to start working on the analytics task. Good luck and happy exploring!
