    "Some questions you could explore are:\n",
    "- Which Machines are responsible for 80% of overall Total Failures? Of overall Total Failure Downtime?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences in the performances of Machines, Shifts, or Operators?\n",
    "- If every minute of Cable Failure Downtime represents eight dollars of lost revenue and Other Failure Downtime represents five dollars then which Machines or Operators are responsible for the most lost revenue? "
